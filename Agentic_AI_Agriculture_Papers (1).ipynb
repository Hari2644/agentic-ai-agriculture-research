We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \\\\key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges.\",\n","  'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06039v1'},\n"," {'title': 'InterPrior: Scaling Generative Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions',\n","  'published_date': '2026-02-05T18:59:27Z',\n","  'summary': 'Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements.

Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability.',\n","  'link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06030v1'}]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":47}]}]}
